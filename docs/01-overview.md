# Project Overview

This is a production-ready desktop application framework built with Rust, WebUI, and Vanilla JavaScript, featuring full-stack capabilities including SQLite integration. The project demonstrates how to build elegant, native desktop applications using web technologies while leveraging Rust's performance and safety for backend logic.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Rust with WebUI framework for desktop application hosting
- SQLite for embedded data storage
- Async runtime with Tokio

### Frontend
- Vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript
- Rspack bundler for fast builds
- Bun for package management

### Build Tools
- Cargo (Rust)
- Bun (frontend)
- Rspack (bundler)
- GCC/Clang (C compiler for WebUI)

### Runtime
- Embedded WebView for UI rendering
- Native desktop application window

## Key Features

- Full MVVM architecture pattern
- Bidirectional frontend-backend communication
- Embedded SQLite database
- Comprehensive logging system
- Configuration management via TOML
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Production-ready build pipeline

## Application Capabilities
